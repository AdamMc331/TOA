# Tasks Of Affirmation

This is a wholesome todo list application. The purpose of this application is to help users
stay organized in their day-to-day lives without feeling the pressure or guilt that can sometimes
arise from tradition todo list applications.

As we build out this project, our goal will remain on how we can look after users and provide a wholesome
and helpful experience as they become and stay organized. 

## Live Streaming

This entire application will be built live on [Adam's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/adammc331).
All streams will be recorded and archived on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/AdamMcNeilly) as well.

**NOTE: Once we have a stream history page, we should add that context here as well.**

## Organization

All work on this project should be recorded in a relevant [issue](https://github.com/AdamMc331/TOA/issues),
and tied to a corresponding GitHub [project](https://github.com/AdamMc331/TOA/projects).
