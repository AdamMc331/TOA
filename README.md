# Tasks Of Affirmation

This is a wholesome todo list application. The purpose of this application is to help users
stay organized in their day-to-day lives without feeling the pressure or guilt that can sometimes
arise from tradition todo list applications.

As we build out this project, our goal will remain on how we can look after users and provide a wholesome
and helpful experience as they become and stay organized. 

## Getting Started

If you've found this repository for the first time, welcome! Our application uses an MVVM architecture which you can read about [here](documentation/Architecture.md). 

The [documentation folder](documentation) can also serve as a guide to getting familiar with this project. This can help build an understanding before you join a live stream - but if you have any questions, just ask in chat. 

## Live Streaming

This entire application will be built live on [Adam's Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/adammc331).
All streams will be recorded and archived on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/AdamMcNeilly) as well.

You can find the recordings and notes from each stream [here](StreamHistory.md). 

## Organization

All work on this project should be recorded in a relevant [issue](https://github.com/AdamMc331/TOA/issues),
and tied to a corresponding GitHub [project](https://github.com/AdamMc331/TOA/projects).
