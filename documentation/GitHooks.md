# Git Hooks

This project has two git hooks included that help ensure code quality seamlessly without requiring manual intervention from the developer. The git hooks can be found in [this folder](../git-hooks). 

There is a pre-commit hook which automatically formats our Kotlin code, and a pre-push hook to make sure all of our static analysis checks pass.
